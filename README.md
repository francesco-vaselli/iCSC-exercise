The following repository contains the code for running the exercise for [my inverted CERN School of Computing lecture](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1334738/contributions/5814283/) on Generative Models for HEP.

If you are not attending in person to the exercise, please leave SWAN machines to the in-person attendees and deploy the notebook on Colab, as SWAN machines are limited in number.
